think of this directory as a kind of 'snapshot' of ezcli that
the new implementations are tested against.

the bin/ directory tells the sanity checker where to find the binaries.
the input/ directory tells the sanity checker which inputs to give to those binaries.
the output/ directory tells the sanity checker what the sane outputs are.

if any kind of fails were found running the sanity checker and 
no changes were made to the binaries currently being sanity-tested,
one of these must hold true:
    - a bug was found,
    - a change was made that requires a major version bump.

paths in bin/ assumes that the sanity checking tests are run from the root
of source.
