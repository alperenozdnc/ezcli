addopt() utility function.
DESCRIPTION_END

void addopt(cli_s *cli, ...opts);

allocates a variable amount of `opt_s` structs to the 'cli->opts'
dynamic array in a 'cli_s' struct.
see 'ezdocs cli_s' and 'ezdocs opt_s' for more details.


note: addopt() does NOT take ownership of opts passed to it. by 'allocates', i mean
it allocates heap space for POINTERS of your opts, not the stack memory they use.
