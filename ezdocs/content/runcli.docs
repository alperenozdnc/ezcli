runcli() core function.
DESCRIPTION_END

void runcli(cli_s *cli_p, int argc, char *argv[]);

parses and runs input in accordance to struct 'cli_p'.


see 'ezdocs cli_s' and 'ezdocs initcli' for an explanation on
what 'cli_p' should be populated with.

runcli() expects 'argv' to start with the command name itself.
you should inject a command name at 'argv[0]' when injecting
artificial arguments into runcli().
