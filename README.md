## ezcli 

ezcli is a cli library that doesn't have much content
but has a lot of flexibility.

no annoying defaults, no opinionated parsing styles,
no forced behaviour. **you** define your own context,
your own behaviour, your own parsing style, because
a cli library shouldn't police the programmer. the
programmer should police the user for correct input,
using the cli library.

read `docs/` in the root directory for details.

### contributing

i accept any kind of feedback as a contribution. here are some ways though;
- opening an issue talking about something in (or not in) ezcli you don't like.
- forking ezcli and opening a pull request.
- tossing a star.

any code written with a nice idea is good enough for me, i will migrate any
contributions to my own code style preferences, so do as you want. but please,
please, no more than 3 indentations.

### license

i think all software should be free and open-source, and even if there needs
to be a paywall, the user should know the code that is running on their device.
pirating exists alongside proprietary code and open-source is generally safer
to use because of the sheer amount of workforce that open-source projects have,
so why would anybody want to make proprietary software if it's not malicious or
behind a paywall?

for those reasons, i use `GPLv3` in all of my projects. see `LICENSE` in the
root directory for details.
